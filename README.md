# Activity Finder

A simple web app that helps you find something fun to do when you're bored!  
It fetches random activity suggestions from the **[Bored API](https://bored.api.lewagon.com/)** and lets you filter by number of participants, activity type, and whether it should be free.

Built as a JavaScript exercise during my web development studies.
